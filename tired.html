    <p>
      If today felt like too much, you don’t have to explain it to<br>
     anyone. Some days feel heavy without a clear reason, no<br>
      big disaster, no obvious mistake, just a quiet weight sitting<br>
     on your chest. And that doesn’t mean you’re weak or ungrateful<br>
     or doing life wrong. It just means you’re human. <br><br>
     You don’t need to be productive here. You don’t need<br>
     to “get over it.” Rest isn’t something you earn after surviving<br>
     the day, it’s something you’re allowed to take during it.<br><br>
     Stay here for a moment. Breathe a little slower. Let your shoulders<br>
    drop.Nothing is asking anything from you right now, and nothing<br>
    needs fixing immediately. Even heavy days pass — and you don’t<br>
     have to carry them alone.
