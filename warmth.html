      Comfort doesn’t always arrive as answers or advice.<br>
      Sometimes it’s just a quiet presence, the feeling that thought<br>
      of you gently, without expecting anything in return.<br><br>
      You don’t have to be strong here. You don’t have to<br>
      explain why you’re tired, or why you feel the way you do. You’re<br>
      allowed to be soft. You’re allowed to be unsure.<br><br>
     Think of this moment like sitting near a window on a calm evening,<br> 
     nothing urgent, nothing loud. Just warmth, slowly reaching you. If the<br>
     world felt a little cold today, let this be the place where it doesn’t.<br><br?
     You are held here, for as long as you want.
