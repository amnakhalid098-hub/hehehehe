  <h1>you are loved</h1>

  <p>
      You matter in ways you don’t even notice.  In<br>
      the way you show up quietly. In the small kindnesses<br>
      you don’t think count. In how your presence makes<br>
      things feel softer without you trying. <br><br>
      You don’t have to be extraordinary every day to be<br>
      meaningful. You don’t have to prove your worth through<br>
      effort, success, or perfection. <br><br>
      Even on the days you doubt yourself, even when you feel<br>
      replaceable or invisible, you are still leaving an imprint. You<br>
     are still important. You are still enough.<br><br>
     The version of you that exists right now, exactly as you are,<br>
     deserves patience and love. Especially from yourself.
